### Sticky Header & Column with DataTable Widget | Custom Widget | Tabular UI | Table UI - Flutter
This is the tutorial project to demonstrate how to create tabular UI with sticky columns and table header.

I have created tabular UI without using any plugis, only with available widgets within flutter framework, so that anyone can get an idea for same how they can use avaialble widgets to build something similar.

I have used following widgets for this to demonstrate:

- DataTable
- SingleChildScrollView
- Column
- Row

You can find the video tutorial on same @ youtube:
